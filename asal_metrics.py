    Parameters
    ----------
    z : jnp.ndarray of shape (T, D)
        The latent representation of the images over time.

    Calculates the supervisted target score from ASAL with softmax.
    This isn't part of the original ASAL, but it's a useful extension.
    This score helps incentivize the simulation to find unique images for each prompt rather than one static image satisfying all prompts.

    ----------
    z : jnp.ndarray of shape (T, D)
        The latent representation of the images over time.
    z_txt : jnp.ndarray of shape (T2, D)
        The latent representation of the text prompts over time.
    temperature_softmax : float
        The temperature for the softmax function. For CLIP, leave it at 0.01, since that is default CLIP softmax temperature.
